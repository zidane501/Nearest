# Nearest

A mobile app in react native for finding the nearest of anything.

The app is buil with expo, and should work if all files are cloned and buil to an .apk file.

Once in the app, press the "Search" button,

which will take you to a mapscreen.

Then write a number and the field below the searchbar will display the amount of names you wrote.

I've also build a webscraper in Python for getting store locaions for different discount stores, and my ambition is in the future to make a search function for discount offers and locations.

Recently I have made an algorithm for finding numbers that the google pic-to-text function doesn't find. I want to make a funtion that gets all the goods in the discount offers and adds the good and its price to a database. I made big progress by finding all the ones from one page and their position.
