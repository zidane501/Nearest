# Nearest
A mobile app in react native for finding the nearest of anything.

The app is buil with expo, and should work if all files are cloned and buil to an .apk file.

Once in the app, press the "Search" button, which will take you to a mapscreen. Then write a number and the field below the searchbar will display the amount of names you wrote.\n
I've also build a webscraper in Python for getting store locaions for different discount stores, and my ambition is in the future to make a seatch function for discount offers and locations.
